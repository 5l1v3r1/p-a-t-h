---:[ Requirements

Perl
Net::RawIP
Snort Rulefiles


---:[ Disclaimer

THIS PROJECT WAS DEVELOPED FOR TESTING AND DEMONSTRATION PURPOSE ONLY! 
THE AUTHORS DONT FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR ILLEGAL ABUSE OF THIS PIECE OF 
SOFTWARE AND WE ADVICE YOU TO USE IT LEGALLY AND DO NOT BREAK THE LAW!


---:[ Description

Feed_snort floods a SN0RT (and other) IDS System with packets, which simulate
an attack, created using SN0RT rule files.
Therefore this script can be very useful to check your current SN0RT 
configuration and demonstrates why you should keep the timeout of guardian.pl 
and other so called intrusion prevention systems at a low limit to avoid abuse 
like starting a DOS attack onto your IDS!
You can specify a list / range of sources / targets (see examples).


---:[ Installation

If your system supports Perl just install the required modules. 


---:[ Usage

Run ./feed_snort.pl --help to get help.


---:[ Examples

This will flood 192.168.0.254 and it looks like the attack is coming from
the ip range 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.50
feed_snort.pl -r /etc/snort/rules -s 192.168.0.1-192.168.0.50 -h 192.168.0.254

This will flood the ips 192.168.0.253 and 192.168.0.254 and it seems that they
are attacking themselves
feed_snort.pl -r /etc/snort/rules -h 192.168.0.253,192.168.0.254
