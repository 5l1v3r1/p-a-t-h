[1] General questions

Q: What is the P.A.T.H. project about?
A: The P.A.T.H. project is a collection of tools for inspecting and hijacking
network connections written in Perl. If you dont know what network hijacking
is here is a short explanation of my own: 
With network hijacking you can hijack a foreign network connection and use it 
as your own, but it also includes inspecting and watching connections and
reacting on special kinds of network events.

Q: What is it good for?
A: Well first of all it's good for rescuing the world from being attacked by
nasty aliens. But if you're tricky you can also use it to test your firewall 
and IDS rules, sniff your network traffic and hopefully demonstrate your users 
why you as a security administrator don't like plain protocols like telnet, 
SMTP and FTP. Additionally you can block (reset) unwanted traffic in your 
internal network without the use of a firewall or subneting or something like 
that. Last but not least you can implement man-in-the-middle attacks by either
poisoning the targets arp cache using ARP reply packets or changing the targets
gateway using ICMP redirect messages.
Maybe it can help you impressing your girlfriend and friends.
Use it what you think it's good for. ;)

Q: Why did you program it?
A: Short answer: It's fun! =)
Longer answer: I also programmed it to have some tools on hand that show why 
one shouldn't use plain protocols like Telnet, SMTP or FTP. 

Q: But there are also some other hijacking projects out there. So why did you 
program all this stuff on your own?
A: The other hijacking projects like ettercap and dsniff are all programmed in 
C. I just wanted to reimplement them in my favourite language Perl.

Q: Where can I find the tools?
A: Every tool has got it's own subdirectory. For example the source of the 
packetgenerator can be found in the subdirectory IP-Packet. If you just 
want to execute the tools type ip-packet.pl or whatever you want to execute
at your next shell prompt. If you wonder where the tools are located have a
looked at /usr/local/bin.

Q: Where can I find more documentation?
A: Please read the readme of the tool you want to use. There are also some 
RFCs and additional documentation located in the docs subdirectory.
If you're still searching for more information visit http://www.crazydj.de
and http://www.krecher.de

Q: Where can I ask questions?
A: Please use my forum: forum.geektown.de Or have a look at the P.A.T.H. 
project page: p-a-t-h.sourceforge.net

Q: How to report a bug I have found in a tool?
A: First of all please have a look at KNOWN_BUGS  before reporting anything. 
If you have really found a new bug please post it at the P.A.T.H. forum 
located at blackboard.geektown.de or have a look at the P.A.T.H. project page: 
http://p-a-t-h.sourceforge.net

Q: How can I support the P.A.T.H. project?
A: You can send bug reports like described above or you can add some code. 
Please read section [4] if you want to help developing the project.

Q: What is the General Public License?
A: Please have a look at the file LICENSE.

[2] Installation

Q: How to install P.A.T.H.?
A: Please read the file INSTALL!

Q: What do I need to install to use the P.A.T.H. project?
A: You need the pcap library [ www.tcpdump.org ] and the following Perl 
modules available at www.cpan.org: Net::RawIP, Net::Pcap, Netpacket, 
Data::Hexdumper. 
You also need XFree86 and the development files of Xlibs and the Tk perl 
module in order to use the gui versions!
Of course you need a Perl interpreter. It should be 5.6.0 or above.

Q: Where can I get the Perl modules?
A: Download them from www.cpan.org (e.g. http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/)

Q: On which OS can I install P.A.T.H.?
A: I have tested P.A.T.H. on Linux (RedHat, SuSE, Debian) and FreeBSD. It 
should also install on Mac OsX and other Unix-like operating systems supporting
the required librarys and Perl.
On Windows you will get the problem that the required modules are only 
available for Unix like systems, but maybe you can compile them on Windows 
using cygwin. You can get it here: http://cygwin.com
And here you can download a Perl interpreter for Windows: 
http://www.activestate.com
Please send me a small report if you can run P.A.T.H. using cygwin or post it 
to the P.A.T.H. forum.

Q: There is more than one Tk module. Which do I have to install?
A: You have to install the module Tk. But it's easier to do it this way: 
perl -MCPAN -eshell
cpan> install Tk
Or if you are lazy type perl -MCPAN -e 'install Tk' ;)

Q: How to install the Perl modules?
A: Either download them from CPAN and install them like described in the 
Modules Readme or use the CPAN module: 
perl -MCPAN -eshell
cpan> install <module>
Or the shorter way perl -MCPAN -e 'install <module>'

Q: I called perl -MCPAN -e 'force install <module>' and now I
have to configure something?
A: You are using CPAN for the first time. Dont care, just say no. ;)

Q: The installation of a Perl module fails! What shall I do?
A: Try to skip the modules function test. Most of the modules will work 
without passing all the tests.
So try the following (as root of course):
cd ~/.cpan/build/modulename
make install
Otherwise send me a bugreport by mail.

[3] Usage

Q: I get the error: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
A: Either the path to the perl interpreter is wrong or you have not installed
Perl. Please check if you have installed perl: whereis perl. All the scripts
will expect the interpreter to be in /usr/bin/perl, maybe you have to create
a symlink (man ln).

Q: How can I start the GUI version of a tool?
A: Use the parameter --gui to do so.

Q: How can I configure the tools?
A: All tools are configure the same way.
-h target-ips 
(Can be a range like 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.254)
(Can also be a list 192.168.1.1,192.168.1.53)
-s source-ips (like target-ips)
-p port (Pass a list or range as described above)
-c connection (e.g. 192.168.1.1-192.168.1.2)
For more information use the parameter --help.

Q: What are EUID 0 privileges and why do I need them?
A: EUID 0 are root privileges and you need them because you need to be root 
to set the network interface into the promiscous mode or to open a raw socket 
to send self constructed packets.

Q: I get sendto() at /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.2/Net/RawIP.pm line 550?
A: You are not allowed to send the constructed packet. Please check if you
are running a packet filtering program (Linux: iptables -L or ipchains -L / 
FreeBSD: ipfw list). If that's not the case and you are trying to send an
icmp redirect packet check if your system allows you to send redirect
messages e.g. look at /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/*redirect or at
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.send_redirects. 
Try sysctl -w net.inet.icmp.drop_redirect=0 under FreeBSD.

Q: What are pcap expression?
A: With pcap you can specify exactly which packets should be sniffed e.g.
host 192.168.1.1 and port 21 or port 23 and tcp to sniff ftp and telnet
traffic coming from or being send to 192.168.1.1. Have a look at the
tcpdump's man page to learn more about the pcap expression language.

Q: What documentation should I read before using P.A.T.H.?
A: Before using the packetgenerator IP-Packet you should have an idea how the 
TCP/IP protocol looks like. There are many documents out there in the net. I 
recommend that you have a look at the hijackersguide written by Stefan Krecher.
You'll find it in the docs directory. If you have got enough time you should 
also read the other documents located in the docs directory. 
No... that's not a bad joke... ;)

[4] Developer question

Q: How can I help developing the project?
A: Please have a look at the TODO files.

Q: Where can I find information about the P.A.T.H Perl modules?
A: There is a README.developer file. You should read it. Every module has 
it's own POD documentation to describe it's methods.
